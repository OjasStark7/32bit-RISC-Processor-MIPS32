This is verilog project where I have created a 32-bit RISC Processor - MIPS32 using verilog in Intel Quartus Prime. I have created a complete code for the processor & created 3 testbenches for verifying different 32-bit instructions. I have simulated all the tests using Modelsim Altera where I have verified the final outputs for each test and I have also used gtkwave to verify the waveforms of all the registers, flags, etc. of the processor.
